## The game rules are as follows:

A deck of playing cards consists of 52 cards, divided into four suits: spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. Each suit has 13 cards numbered from 1 to 13.

At the beginning of the game, all 52 cards are placed face down on the table, and players need to flip the cards to reveal their numbers.

Players can only flip two cards at a time. If the two flipped cards have the same number, it is a successful match, and the matched cards can be kept in the flipped position. If the match is unsuccessful, the cards will be flipped back over, and players need to remember the numbers to find a successful match in the next turn.

The goal for players is to flip all 52 cards or 26 pairs. Each successful match earns 10 points, and the objective is to accumulate 260 points to complete the mission.
